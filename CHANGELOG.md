## 0.2.1

* Added the `c` operator (thanks Yosef!)
* Cursor appears as block in command mode and blinks when inserting (thanks Corey!)
* Delete operations now save deleted text to the default buffer
* Implement 'gg' and 'G' motions
* Implement 'P' operator
* Implement 'o' and 'O' commands

## 0.2.0

* Added yank and put command with support for registers
* Added '$' and '^' motions
* Fixed repeats for commands and motions, ie `d2d` works as expected.
* Implemented `D` to delete through the end of the line.
* Implemented `>>` and `<<` indent and outdent commands.
* Implemented `J`.
* Implemented `a` to move cursor and enter insert mode.
* Add basic scrolling using `ctrl-u` and `ctrl-d`.
* Add basic undo/redo using `u` and `ctrl-r`. This needs to be improved so it
  understands vim's semantics.

## 0.1.0

* Nothing changed, used this as a test release to understand the
  publishing flow.

## 0.0.1

* Initial release, somewhat functional but missing many things.
